Current:
-make sure the order of the below steps makes sense
-fixed time step
-state stack?
	-maybe just two states?
		-1) some explanation of how to play
		-2) game
-figure out MVC
	-where does ResourceHandler (give credit) go?
-SceneNode (probably without parent-child system)
-scene layers (probably not in the way the book does it)
-set up static (unmoving) view
-background (below the platform): texture repeating/scrolling
-draw/update
-process movement

Eventually:
-delete the sample files at some point

OOP Classes (incomplete):
