Current:
--------
-state stack?
	-add handleEvent() for each state
		-TitleState
			-make it possible to go from junk title screen to junk game screen
		-GameState
			-move the square when appropriate
			-pause:
				-controller stops doing anything
	-fix folder organization (e.g. put states in States folder)
-ResourceHandler
	-import classes and cite sources
	-apply to TitleState, etc.
-fixed time step
-figure out (MV)C
	-maybe use the basic square example to start making GameView
	and World classes, then can work on things like
	separating out the key bindings to other classes
-SceneNode (probably without parent-child system)
-scene layers (probably not in the way the book does it)
-set up static (unmoving) view
-background (below the platform): texture repeating/scrolling
-draw/update
-process movement

Eventually:
-----------
-delete the sample files and Game folder
