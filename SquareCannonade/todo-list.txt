Current:

TRY TO JUST FOCUS ON THE BELOW STEPS, ONE AT A TIME

-fixed time step
-state stack?
	-maybe just two states?
		-1) some explanation of how to play
		-2) game
			-however, is option to pause; just disables controller
	-end result: can go from junk title screen to junk
	game screen
-figure out MVC
	-maybe use the basic square example to start making GameView
	and World classes, then can work on things like
	separating out the key bindings to other classes
-SceneNode (probably without parent-child system)
-scene layers (probably not in the way the book does it)
-set up static (unmoving) view
-background (below the platform): texture repeating/scrolling
-draw/update
-process movement

Eventually:
-delete the sample files at some point
