# SFML-Square-Cannonade-Game
Named "Square Cannonade" until I find a better name, this game, to be programmed in C++ and SFML, will allow the player to control a square as he/she tries to grab all the coins in a level before being defeated by cannons that shoot squares. This isn't meant to be a big game.
