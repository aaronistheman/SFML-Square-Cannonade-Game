# SFML-Square-Cannonade-Game (Currently Unfinished)

(Last updated: 10/10/2016)

About
-----

Named "Square Cannonade" until I find a better name, this game, 
to be programmed in C++ and SFML, will allow the player to control
a square as he/she tries to grab all the coins in a level before
being defeated by cannons that shoot squares. I will use a
pathfinding algorithm (most likely A*) to create enemies
that navigate around walls to chase the player.

Implementation-Specific Features
--------------------------------

* "Catch" framework for test-driven development where helpful.

More to be announced.

Gameplay-Specific Features
--------------------------

To be announced.

How to Run Application
----------------------

(These steps have yet to be tested for absolute correctness.)
Using Visual Studio 2015, open SquareCannonade.sln.
Make sure the startup project is set to SquareCannonade.
Run the project (use F5 or Ctrl+F5).

How to Run Tests
----------------

(These steps have yet to be tested for absolute correctness.)
Using Visual Studio 2015, open SquareCannonade.sln.
Make sure the startup project is set to SquareCannonadeTest.
Run the project (use Ctrl+F5, not F5,
or else the console window won't stay open).

Releases
--------

No releases yet. Hopefully will be one by the end of October.
