# SFML-Square-Cannonade-Game (Currently Unfinished)

(Last updated: 09/24/2016)

About
-----

Named "Square Cannonade" until I find a better name, this game, 
to be programmed in C++ and SFML, will allow the player to control
a square as he/she tries to grab all the coins in a level before
being defeated by cannons that shoot squares.
This isn't meant to be a big game.

Helpful Resources

* "SFML Game Development" by Artur Moreira, Henrik Vogelius
Hansson, and Jan Haller. I borrowed certain classes (e.g.
ResourceHolder) or based certain classes (e.g. Application) on those from the
source code associated with this book.
