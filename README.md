# SFML-Square-Cannonade-Game (Currently Unfinished)

(Last updated: 09/24/2016)

About
-----

Named "Square Cannonade" until I find a better name, this game, 
to be programmed in C++ and SFML, will allow the player to control
a square as he/she tries to grab all the coins in a level before
being defeated by cannons that shoot squares.
This isn't meant to be a big game.

Implementation-Specific Features
--------------------------------

* Separation of controller logic from model/view logic.
 * I did not separate model logic and view logic, because this would have
  arguably made the code more messy for not enough benefit.
  (SFML expects the draw functions to take models as arguments,
  but those models end up needing draw methods for this to work,
  so I did not want to force an awkward separation.)

Gameplay-Specific Features
