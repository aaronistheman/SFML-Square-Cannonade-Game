# SFML-Square-Cannonade-Game (Currently Unfinished)

(Last updated: 09/24/2016)

About
-----

Named "Square Cannonade" until I find a better name, this game, 
to be programmed in C++ and SFML, will allow the player to control
a square as he/she tries to grab all the coins in a level before
being defeated by cannons that shoot squares.
This isn't meant to be a big game.
